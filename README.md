A simple and small library which provides an opinionated view onto asserts for the sake of input parameter validation.
Many errors more than often result from missing or insufficient input parameter validation. This is particularly true
for JavaScript and alike.

## Installation

The package can be installed with:

```bash
npm install @bvfnbk/node-assert
```

## API

**Please note:** The API documentation is not contained in the repository. It is rather supposed to be deployed to 
_some_ service which is not _yet_ clear. Until then, checkout this repository and `npm install` its development
dependencies.

The `jsdoc` documentation can be created with

```bash
npm run jsdoc
```

Open `dist/docs/api/index.html` with your favourite browser.
